I use specialized tools to organize my development process and task tracking, write quality documentation and perform work in time.

Also can make prototypes, 'am good at HTML, CSS and JavaScript (+TypeScript), can build android apps and dynamic adaptive cross-browser web-apps, using Vue 3 (Composition or Options), Nuxt 3 (or React) as frontend and Python or Node (Nest) as backend.

I have experience with such concepts as:

* microservices,
* data visualisation libraries (like d3, chart.js etc.),
* team leadership and mentoring,
* B2B, B2C development, including e-commerce, SaaS, PaaS and so on.
